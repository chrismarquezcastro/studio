          <h4>Problems observed</h4>
          <p>
            The navigation across the application wasn’t intuitive. For example
            the main navigation was permanently available in the tablet, but on
            phones the user needed to navigate all the way up in the tree to get
            to the menu.
          </p>

            src="./images/v1-movetray-actions-phone.png"
            alt="Action menus phone old version"
          />
          <p>
            The look and feel was too different from the mental models and
            interactions used by the operating systems (iOS, Android).
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/v1-actions-tablet.png"
            alt="Actions menu tablet old version"
          />
          <p>
            There was no way to understand how and if people were using our
            products and services.
          </p>
          <img

          <h4>Hypothesis</h4>
          <p>
            There was no need to force the same UI across all platforms. There
            are plenty of UI patterns and components native to each platform and
            form factor, there is no need to re-invent everything.
            <br /><br />
            Better design decisions could be made if we could track down the
            user real behavior as much as possible.
          </p>
          <h4>What the stake-holders asked me to solve</h4>
          <p>
            This is one of those projects where no one formally asked me to
            solve anything specifically.
            <br /><br />
            My motivation was driven by listening to the customer support team
            about customer complaints and some key PM members.
            <br /><br />
            Once I planted the idea and showed some options, the requests
            started coming in, for example it was during this iteration that the
            first version of the camera mode hit the market.
          </p>
          <h4>How I set up to solve the problem</h4>
          <p>
            I explored the market for similar products on the B2C space to
            identify the simpler and common patters. Specially the native
            Material Design and iOS components.
            <br /><br />
            Interview external and internal stake-holders to get their
            perspective on the current state of the app.
            <br /><br />
            The interview also dived into the expectations for the application,
            in terms of business value to Kiteworks as well as its customers.
            <br /><br />
            Prototype and validate different ideas for navigation, key areas of
            the product as well as new functionality.

          <h4>Collaboration across teams</h4>
          <p>
            It was key to socialize the problem among the PM and new executives,
            get them involved in the problem and the solution.
            <br /><br />
            Partnering with PM and Engineering leads helped me balance the
            design ideas to meet the crucial business needs while optimizing
            development.
            <br /><br />
            It was critical to manage the expectations from development and the
            executives so that progress was made at a good pace.
            <br /><br />
            Frequent check-ins with the customer support team helped to get a
            perspective from someone who have heard the bad feedback of the
            previous version.
          </p>
          <h4>Facilitation</h4>
          <p>
            The Product Manager and I engaged with internal and external
            stake-holders in a cycle of design reviews and iterations.
            <br /><br />
            The Engineering teams and I identified the best approach to design
            and develop the necessary components, re-using as much as possible
            from each native library.
          </p>
          <h4>Impact to the team</h4>
          <p>
            The new design enabled new workflows like the camera view that will
            go on to be used more widely in future releases.

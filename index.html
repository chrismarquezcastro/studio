          <h4>Collaboration across teams</h4>
          <p>
            As Product Designer, my goal is to gain enough insights into the
            problem to produce ideas that can be tested and improved toward
            solving the problem efficiently.
            <br /><br />
            I partner with UX team members to brainstorm ideas to re-use content
            and patterns, and to develop the cohesive style, including voice.
            <br /><br />
            I partner with Product Managers to better understand the impact of
            the problem in the organization as a whole, they also are great
            advocates for the customer and the end user.
            <br /><br />
            I partner with Engineers to brainstorm ideas and the potential
            opportunities provided by technology, as well as to implement the UI
            design to the best quality.
          </p>
          <h4>Facilitation</h4>
          <p>
            Initially I had multiple interviews with stake-holders to gain
            insights, most cases during video calls 1-1. Once I produced the
            first prototype I started having review meetings with larger groups
            from different teams.
            <br /><br />
            Once the UX design is mostly defined I do a kick-off meeting with
            the Engineering team that is going to work on the feature to present
            and answer questions about the project.

          <h2>Admin is prompted to verify a list of security settings.</h2>
          <h4>
            This was one of the first ideas tested at the interaction level, and
            was constantly iterated as the main entry point.
          </h4>
          <p>
            The list is organized by sections that map to the Admin UI
            information architecture.<br /><br />When the user changes the
            settings to reduce the risk, the item is then removed from the list.

          <h2>UX + Product owner</h2>

            This is the most complex project I had to extend my role into the
            Product Management realm.
          </h4>
          <p>
            I already took on the role of product owner for many projects,
            mostly UX improvements, but this was the first time a critical item
            on the release was in large part my responsibility.

          <h4>Senior UX, Product Designer</h4>
          <p>
            The role that Chris has played evolved throughout his time at
            Kiteworks; to think more systematically, to wage usability and
            security, to care about market-fit as much as ease of use, but most
            importantly to collaborate effectively with teams across the
            organization and the world.

            Chris joined Swipp about 4 months before launching to the world, the
            goal was to design the product, particularly the mobile apps. He
            left the company after months of hard work, more than a few product
            pivots, foosball tournaments, you know, startup stuff…

          <p>
            When Talenthouse invited Chris to help design a platform for the
            community to engage with game-changing opportunities, it felt like
            he got his very own game-changing opportunity. It was his first
            chance in the United States of America, and he was about to grab it
            by the horns…

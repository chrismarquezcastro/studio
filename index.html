          <h4>Problems observed</h4>
          <p>
            Kiteworks admins are in charge of enabling the business processes
            and reducing the risks to the system and the data. Some settings
            could be misused, opening the content and / or system to
            vulnerabilities that could create serious problems for the customer
            organization, as well as the Kiteworks organization.
            <br /><br />
            People working as Admins usually have little time to spare, so a
            focused experience automatically presented upon update or sign in,
            will allow affected admins to confirm the security settings that
            apply to their system.
          </p>
          <h4>Hypothesis</h4>
          <p>
            One of the top priorities of the administrators is to keep the
            system secure against bad actors and poor decision making.
            Therefore, Admins are willing to rapidly take action on security
            related issues.
            <br /><br />
            Admins are capable of making this decision, either on the spot or
            later in the short term.
          </p>
          <h4>What the stake-holders asked me to solve</h4>
          <p>
            The Kiteworks security team identified a few settings that would
            like system admins to review and confirm the state of these settings
            to prevent risks.
            <br /><br />
            Enabling admins to confirm the settings with urgency, high clarity
            and without much disruption.
          </p>
          <h4>How I set up to solve the problem</h4>
          <p>
            First I spoke to the security team members to understand the kind of
            settings and the risks involved with each.
            <br /><br />
            I worked with the Product Manager on the team to identify the number
            of customers that had the security settings activated.
            <br /><br />
            Once I understood the risks and the scope of the problem, I set
            myself to prototype ideas for the interaction scenarios.
            <br /><br />
            Using the prototype I tested the user experience flows with team
            members from UX, PM, Engineering, and Support as well as real
            customer’ admins to validate the ideas and iterate the prototype.

    <!-- My role -->

        <div class="slide-left-column"><h3>My Role</h3></div>
        <div class="slide-right-column group-text">
          <h4>Collaboration across teams</h4>
          <p>
            As Product Designer, my goal is to gain enough insights into the
            problem to produce ideas that can be tested and improved toward
            solving the problem efficiently.
            <br /><br />
            I partner with UX team members to brainstorm ideas to re-use content
            and patterns, and to develop the cohesive style, including voice.
            <br /><br />
            I partner with Product Managers to better understand the impact of
            the problem in the organization as a whole, they also are great
            advocates for the customer and the end user.
            <br /><br />
            I partner with Engineers to brainstorm ideas and the potential
            opportunities provided by technology, as well as to implement the UI
            design to the best quality.
          </p>
          <h4>Facilitation</h4>
          <p>
            Initially I had multiple interviews with stake-holders to gain
            insights, most cases during video calls 1-1. Once I produced the
            first prototype I started having review meetings with larger groups
            from different teams.
            <br /><br />
            Once the UX design is mostly defined I do a kick-off meeting with
            the Engineering team that is going to work on the feature to present
            and answer questions about the project.

          <h2>Admin is prompted to verify a list of security settings.</h2>
          <h4>
            This was one of the first ideas tested at the interaction level, and
            was constantly iterated as the main entry point.
          </h4>
          <p>
            The list is organized by sections that map to the Admin UI
            information architecture.<br /><br />When the user changes the
            settings to reduce the risk, the item is then removed from the list.

          <h4>What can the users do now, VS before</h4>
          <p>
            More than 80% of customers engaged with the interaction and
            completed the workflow, this caused minimal impact in the customer
            support organization, which eventually converted the remaining
            customers.
          </p>
          <h4>Life improvements</h4>
          <p>
            Less customers out there with potential exposures, and for those
            remaining now there is a record of someone manually confirming the
            setting in case of a dispute.

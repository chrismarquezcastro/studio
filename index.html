          <h3>Admin is prompted to verify a list of security settings.</h3>
          <h4>
            This was one of the first ideas tested at the interaction level, and
            was constantly iterated as the main entry point.
          </h4>
          <p>
            The list is organized by sections that map to the Admin UI
            information architecture.<br /><br />When the user changes the
            settings to reduce the risk, the item is then removed from the list.
